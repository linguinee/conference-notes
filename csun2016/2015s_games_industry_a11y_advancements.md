## Why games?

There are so many things to tackle in accessibility – why games?

* Gaming is a $90 billion industry. The movies industry is $50bn and the music industry is $15bn.
* Games are a big part of our culture. Being excluded from a part of our culture isn't good.
* There's more to life than just getting by. So much of accessibility is just getting the basics down.
  * Culture, recreation, socializing – things that contribute to quality of life
  * "Existing vs living"

## CVAA

21st Century Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act – the games industry is explicitly noted in this. Games industry had a temporary waiver until October 2015.

### Classifications

* Class 1: Consoles
* Class 2: Networks
* Class 3: Software

Software has a further waiver for implementing accessibility, but consoles and networks must be accessible now.

## PS4 and Xbox One

PS4 and Xbox One have integrated suites of console-level accessibility:

* Built-in screen reader
* High-contrast mode
* Zoom mode

PS4 has the edge in terms of breadth of features. Xbox One has the edge in terms of functions like zoom.

### Xbox One

Xbox One video tutorial explaining accessibility features:

* Narrator, magnifier, and closed captioning
 * Settings > All settings > Ease of access
* Narrator reads text on the screen (screen reader)
 * Turn on by holding Xbox button until it vibrates and select Narrator
* Magnifier zooms
 * Turn on by holding Xbox button until it vibrates and select Magnifier

The video tutorial is something to learn from! Video tutorials would be amazing for any accessibility features and products, e.g. Apple VoiceOver video tutorials.

We can learn from Xbox One! Being open and being transparent about the things you're working on. They have a dedicated support forum and open channels in social media for feature requests, reviews, and public discourse. Users love this!

### "They're just doing this for compliance."

At these companies, there have been a lot of people talking about how passionate they are about accessibility. No doubt CVAA has played a role in terms of setting a deadline and getting more people talking about it, but there have been accessibility champions within the games industry even before CVAA.

Both Playstation and Xbox features go beyond compliance.

## Tools

Sony and BBC have been working on internal tools.

BBC has a strong accessibility culture because its publicly funded. Content doesn't go out until it's met as many accessibility requirements as reasonably possible.

## Advocacy Organizations

* [SpecialEffect: The Gamer's Charity](http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/)
* [International Game Developers Association (IGDA) – Game Accessibility Special Interest Group](https://www.igda.org/)
* [The AbleGamers Charity](http://www.ablegamers.com/)

At CSUN this year, there are six talks about gaming! A lot more advocacy and talk about accessibility in gaming going on. Last week, there was GDC. There were a number of accessibility talks there, with record attendance of ~135 people on average.

## Game Development

Game engines have historically been a big blocker for accessibility. If a game engine isn't compatible with a screen reader, the game developer can't do anything.

Unreal Engine has included real-time colorblindness simulator for developers. Unity has implemented engine-level button UI so that users can map controls to different buttons.

A lot of people have been communicating with game engines on accessibility. Instead of reactionary dismissal, now there's been reactionary interest.

## Switch Access

All you need to do is develop an interface to be compatible with the switch access box. iOS and Android are already compatible with switch access.

There was a bit of a hole with iOS in that it didn't really work with some games due to how switch access worked. iOS had implemented a workaround for clicking on a specific point: the user selects coordinates to click on by first clicking to stop a line that went left to right, and clicking to stop another line that went top to bottom. Games like Flappy Bird didn't work with the workaround that they implemented, though, because the first click would already flap the bird's wings. Users communicated this to Apple, and they implemented a fix for this: once you've chosen coordinates, you can now hit repeatedly on that spot. Now thousands of games are accessible.

## Government-Funded

### Film Victoria – Australia

Provide government grants for developing all over the industry, including gaming. They ask two questions about accessibility:

* "Are you thinking about accessibility?"
* "If so, tell us how. If not, tell us why."

Melbourne game development community is the most familiar with accessibility by far, due to these two questions.

### Creative Europe

Used Film Victoria as a case study and included accessibility criteria. They take it one step further and use it as an assessment criteria.

## Global Game Jam

Hired an executive producer to oversee the running of all events. The person they hired is a passionate accessibility advocate.

There are optional challenges that teams can choose. This year, there were seven diversifiers related to accessibility (e.g. no visuals). 3,000 teams took part, which meant ~10,000 developers being aware of accessibility! Even with creating a game in two days, teams saw that they could make a large impact on accessibility and that it didn't take much more specialized knowledge or money.

## Awareness

2014 headline: "Borderlands 2 getting colorblind mode"
2016 headline: "Inaccessible: what I should have said in my review of The Witness"

Thinking about accessibility was big news in 2014. Now, in 2016, not thinking about it is bad practice. Huge change in thinking in two years!

## Game Example: Evolve

Ian showed a screenshot of the help page of Evolve:

>     *   5 Hunter Pre-set controller schemes
>     *   4 Monster Pre-set controller schemes
>     *   4 Left sick/right stick layouts

## Q&A

**Software got an extended date for CVAA – what's the timeline?**  
January 2017, allowing for more R&D time. It's not a fixed end date; it may be extended again.

**On one end, you have mainstream games that need to be more accessible. For gamers with severe motor or sensory limitations, is there a need to create specialized games for those users?**  
Yes, there is that need. I've worked on similar games for preschool children. Bear in mind what people want to consume as well. People want to play Minecraft, people want to play CoD. It's just about a bit more flexibility in those mainstream games. Even just having a range of difficulty levels would open up games for a lot of users.

**Top two or three easy wins? Things that would make a huge difference that all game developers should be thinking about.**  
The top thing to consider is where in the relevant process you think about this. In Witcher, with low-contrast, tiny text, it was a lot of work to fix the UI everywhere. If they had thought about it before and not used text below 20px, it would've been fine.

Difficulty reading is one of the top things. 40% of the population has difficulty reading. People are ashamed and don't talk about it as much. There are simple things you can do: decent sized font, don't put text on timers, have good contrast.
