Japan doesn't have legal requirements for accessibility. How do you convince people that accessible websites are important?

This was an interesting talk because they talked about framing accessibility in terms of culture (specifically, Japanese culture). Often, we talk about things in Western-centric ways, so learning about different ways of talking about accessibility is pretty cool!

## Being Right Is Not Enough!

* Marketing web a11y is hard – however, making web content accessible is the right thing to do.
* How can we promote the benefits of web a11y in Japan? (without laws requiring it)

### "Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program"

"In our analysis, the reason humans have not been to Mars is, essentially, the result of a marketing failure."

#### Marketing Failure of Web A11y

* Too much emphasis on people with disabilities – vital, but it is more than that
* Do we need another, better phrase than "Web Accessibility"?
  * but another phrase can bring further confusion
* Rebranding Web A11y is the key for marketing success

## True Benefits of Web A11y

* If web content is accessible enough, it can be used
  * by various types of people
  * with various types of devices
  * in various situations/contexts
* Web a11y is necessary, not only for those with disabilities, but for ALL
  * designing for diversity can benefit all of us

"Web accessibility means that people can use the web."

## Accessibility is a Vital Quality for the Web

* In the multi-device era, every single webpage can be accessed from various devices
* A11y should be prioritized as the most important quality of web content
  * IoT/WoT is coming, we need to prepare for more diverse utilization of web

## Web Accessibility First

("Mobile First", "User First", etc.)

### Is Creating Accessible Web Content Difficult?

* Web content can be easily accessible, in comparison with other medias
* Many web designers/developers have already done a great deal regarding a11y
  * regardless whether they recognize they're performing a11y role
  * further encourage them, work together

### Overlaps Between Accessibility and SEO

* Can we use "SEO" for the sake of rebranding web a11y?
  * Article "The Accessibility & SEO Myth"
  * We should correlate accessibility and UX instead

Peter Morville's User Experience Honeycomb

### WCAG should be more understandable

* WCAG 2.0 too abstract, like the law

## Can we measure ROI of Web A11y?

* NO
  * can't measure the efficiency of defective products
  * ensuring a11y is a part of web design
* Web Standards movement could take off without ROI discussion
  * stop asking the wrong question!

## Conclusion

* Marketing web a11y, placing more emphasis on user experience in terms of multi-device usage
  * rather than on specific types of people/usage
* Promoting web a11y as a quality
  * rather than measures for people with disabilities
  * rather than measures for reducing legal risks
* For Designers/Developers, better resources are necessary
* Stop answering the wrong question about ROI

### Mottainai (もったいない)

Inaccessible web design = "Mottainai" web design

* "Mottainai" is a Japanese term conveying a sense of regret concerning waste
* Inaccessible content doesn't capitalize on the best characteristics of the web
  * more appropriate use of web technologies leads to a more accessible web
