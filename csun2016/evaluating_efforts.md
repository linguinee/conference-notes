"Continuous improvement requires *systematic* evaluation. Continuous improvement requires *unfiltered* evaluation."

Evaluation of Accessibility:

1. Process
2. Outcome

Always think about the purpose. How will this evaluation be used?

## Evaluating Process

* Change takes time
* Tweaking your way to success is most typical
* Process evaluation is needed to see if you are on target, how to improve, and where to go next

What are ways to motivate people to consider accessibility? Are they sustainable?

### Cycle

1. Begin with your overall implementation plan.
  * Assuming you have your "big picture" figured out, with benchmarks, goals, etc.
2. Select a timeframe (mini plan).
  * Some folks with look at this iterative process in various length cycles (e.g. semester, year, two years)
3. Create a document specific for this cycle (use SMART goals).
  * SMART = Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound
4. Determine data gathering needs.
  * e.g. overarching goals is to increase the number of faculty members that know how to make their materials accessible; specific goal is to reach 100 faculty members – therefore there should be sign-in and attendance recording to track this goal
5. Do your plan, then engage in the review.
6. Document the assessment results.

## Evaluating Outcomes

"However beautiful the strategy, you should occassionally look at the results."  
"One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their *results*."

You need a methodology, you need evaluators, and you need to create a report.

### 3 Levels of Knowledge

* Beginning/Anyone
  * Keyboard, "click here", page title, captions, run a tool?
* Intermediate/Trained Staff
  * WCAG 2.0, WAVE, some screen reader testing, PDF?
* Advanced/Highly-skilled Staff
  * APIs, DOM, ARIA, mobile?

### WCAG-EM

1. **Define** the evaluation scope
2. **Explore** the target website
3. **Select** a representative sample
4. **Audit** the selected sample
5. **Report** the evaluation findings

### Report Contents

* Executive summary
* Statement of conformance with WCAG (*and* occasionally 508)
* Severity scale
* Common issues
* Page-specific issues

## Communicate Your Results

Tracking data over time is useful. A lot of the time, people know what their results are, but it stays internal to their team or their task force. Results are a call to action! Make sure that information is in a public space within your organization.

## Q&A

**How do you do a quantitative analysis to demonstrate progress to stakeholders?**  
I don't know if I have a best answer, but WCAG-EM uses "essential processes" or "pages" or something like that to demonstrate progress.

**When you do an evaluation of web accessibility outcomes, are you presenting percentages of pages that conform and don't conform, and severity?**  
Correct. Assigning severity to issues and bugs, yes.
