What are the best practices for reporting accessibility problems and remediation solutions to designers and developers? Screenshots? Code snippets? Live demos? Multiple accessibility testers?

**Agenda**

* Scoping the website or mobile application
* Finding the issues and reporting
* Reviewing and navigating through the report live demo
* Advantages of report format

## Scoping

* URLs
* Logins/passwords
* VPN credentials
* Out-of-scope items or sections of the site
* Testing standard (508/WCAG 2.0 AA)
* AT testing platforms

## Project Wide Issues

* Common project wide issues
  * header
  * footer
  * navigation
* Common widgets
  * modal dialogs
  * calendar picker
  * forms and error validation
* Social media icons

## Reports

### Why is reporting project wide helpful?

* Avoid repeating the same issue on every single page
* Saves time for both tester and the person reviewing the report

### Importance of screenshots

* Identify the location of issue to the visual user
* Avoid misunderstandings between SMEs and clients – both parties can agree on areas that will be tested and what to avoid
* Site tested is often changing frequently or still being developed – screenshots capture what was tested
* Time consuming to reproduce certain accessibility errors
* More accessible for people with cognitive disabilities
* Issue description serves as the alt text
* SMEs can remember the actual problem they tested three months ago without visiting the site

### Questions to ask when reporting an issue

* Who is facing the barrier?
* What is the problem exactly?
* Where is this found?
* When does it occur?
* How can this be fixed?
* How big is the impact? Can the user get to where they need to in a different way?

#### Impact

* How big is the barrier?
* Can users accomplish their goals?
* Was it impossible to perform the task?
* Was the user able to accomplish the task but in an easier way?

### Format

Deque reports are in Keynote, which is accessible on the Mac and iOS phones and tablets.
