## Accessibility in the Private and Public Sectors

"Accessibility is a service we provide." – Blackboard  
"Accessibility is a civil right." – University of Montana

Mature, sustainable accessibility programs live somewhere in the middle of these perspectives.

Mature accessibility programs consider the needs of people with diverse abilities as well as the systems in use to develop processes focused on meeting those goals.

## Accessibility Programs: Private Sector

### Keys to a Sustainable Accessibility Program

Understanding where you are today → Building a deeper awareness ⇄ Developing strong partnerships ⇄ Defining a clear strategy

### Blackboard History

Rewrote interface during an acquisition. "Watch for the moments when the chance to make changes lines up with company goals and objectives." Blackboard wanted to merge Blackboard and WebCT and didn't care about a11y. However, coupled with client pressures for accessibility, this created opportunities for change.

In 2011, they had their first WCAG conformance statements for Blackboard Learn & Collaborate. In 2012, however, they lost focus and accessibility fell off the wayside.

In 2014, changes in leadership created additional opportunities for change. Full time role for a11y in 2015, and in 2016, an Accessibility Strategy was developed.

The goal is sustained and maintained improvements for accessibility.

### Understanding Where You Are

The best place to start is by understanding where you are today.

* Talk to people
* Collect existing documentation and review the development process
* Test the product yourself
* Share the results with stakeholders
* Assess, assess, and re-assess

#### Blackboard Accessibility Health Assessment

Complete baseline assessments of your current state. Use those to generate quarterly improvement goals and send monthly status updates to key stakeholders.

1. **Unknown**  
Nothing is known about how this product meets accessibility requirements.
2. **Unacceptable**  
This product is not meeting defined minimum accessibility requirements.
3. **Immature**  
This product is beginning to work towards meeting accessibility requirements.
4. **Acceptable**  
This product has made significant progress towards meeting accessibility requirements.
5. **Mature**  
This product is meeting the majority of defined accessibility requirements with just a few remaining issues to resolve.
6. **Outstanding**  
This product is fully meeting or exceeding all defined accessibility requirements.

### Blackboard Training Approach

Create targeted training programs to help each group understand why a11y is their responsibility. Engineer vs marketer vs sales rep are all different roles.

#### Building Deeper Awareness

Include people with diverse abilities in your user research.

* Contact NFB, NAD, etc. for help people to work with
* Use contextual inquiry methods to observe people where they are most comfortable
* Use structured interviews and activities to gain empathy and build insight

### Developing Strong Partnerships

To maintain a culture of accessibility, maintain partnerships. Building external partnerships is pretty easy.

* Reach out to people
* Get accessibility minded client talking to each other
* Integrate clients into existing feedback loops

#### Blackboard's Partnership Programs

* The type of client partnerships you establish will depend on where in the development of your program you are
  * For Blackboard, these are the University of Montana, Boise State University, Syracuse University, University of Cincinnati, California State University, etc.
* Build a strong network of accessibility experts to turn to when you find yourself stuck and unsure how to move forward
  * For Blackboard, these are Deque, SSB BART Group, NFB, NAD, etc.

#### Internal Partnerships

* Find the champions within your organization
* Share stories, challenges, and wins
* Cultivate partners by looking for ways to change thinking while also saving them time

### Establishing a Clear Strategy

Your strategy provides you with one of your best communication tools.

* Be provocative!
* State what you believe your company should stand for
* Create specific areas of focus and map them to the corporate mission and vision

#### Blackboard's Strategy

"Reimagining Education."

* Accessibility is an imperative, not an afterthought.
  * As we work to reimagine education on a global scale, we have a unique opportunity to positively impact the learning lives of people with disabilities. To do so, we must deeply integrate accessibility thinking into all aspects of our organizational culture.
* Understand, empathize, and act.
  * Teachers and students' fundamental goals remain the same, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities. We must endeavor to fully understand the needs of people with disabilities. However, awareness is not enough. We must act.
* Deliver the promise.
  * The edu-tech industry's accessibility focus is rapidly increasing due to the tremendous promise technology offers to people with disabilities. We must focus on providing tools and services that deliver on this promise and inspire people of all abilities to learn.

#### Strategic Focus at Blackboard

Start small. Let the program grow as you learn more and start to achieve some success.

* Product
  * Our products are the metrics we are measured by in the effort to deliver high quality, genuinely usable experiences for all users.
* Culture
  * Accessibility is not just about the products; every employee has the potential to positively impact the interaction between our company and people with disabilities.
* Community
  * Awareness begins with education and is maintained through knowledge sharing and continued learning across the company.
* Education
  * No matter how solid our awareness and empathy is, we are drawing on incomplete judgements if we do not actively engage the accessibility community.

A strategy is a constantly evolving document. Everything you learn will influence its evolution.

## Accessibility Programs: Public Sector

Accessibility is a civil right.

Strong legislation about equal access opportunity: ADA, Section 508, state and local laws. Accessibility in education has strong legal implications and legislations we need to comply with.

Compliance checklist:

* Documents
* Web
* Media and captions
* Procurement
* Training

### Keys to a Sustainable Accessibility Program

Need a strategy first! This is in contrast to Blackboard's process, which started with understanding the current state of things.

Defining a clear strategy → Understanding where you are today ⇄ Building a deeper awareness ⇄ Developing strong partnerships

### Timeline for the University of Montana

* OCR complaint around electronic a11y in 2012
* Developed strategy to meet OCR concerns
* Established EITA Policy (Electronic Information Technology Accessibility) in 2013
* Sustained effort underway around a11y training and awareness
* Submitted remediation report in 2016

EITA Policy: http://www.umt.edu/accessibility/  
"Accessibility is a shared campus responsibility."

### Extensive Training Efforts

Develop diverse models:

* Face-to-face trainings
* Online trainings
* Just-in-time supports

"Accessibility is never a new topic."

## Q&A

**For the University of Montana, how did you initially determine where your accessibility stood?**  
Self-study required by Office of Civil Rights to get a baseline with where you're at.

**For the University of Montana, is accessibility training required, or ad hoc as people request it, or other?**  
For web accessibility, to use the Cascade system, teachers need to pass a quiz for accessibility. Went to provost and talked to academic officers and said that all departments need to come in for 3 workshops. We developed cohorts and hold up star departments. Professors, admins, grad students, TAs, etc. are brought into the training.

So right now, it's mostly ad hoc for us. We're on the cusp of launching compliance training for all faculty, including adjuncts.One of the students who filed the OCR complaint insisted that they require testing before professors can access the LMS. That's coming for us.
