Stein Erik Skotkjerra, Lotte Johansen, Tom Widrøe

Ducked into this session real quick – it was interesting because they built the culture from "bottom up". From their abstract: "How can organizations build a strong accessibility culture from nearly nothing? We managed to do it, and believe our story will help inspire other companies!"

They mentioned [pa11y](http://pa11y.org/), the "automated accessibility testing pal".
