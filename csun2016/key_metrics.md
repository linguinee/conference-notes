* Can be verified with key metrics

Crew

* Online Accessibility Liaisons
* Digital Accessibility Program Office

"Give accessibility the same attention, governance, and accountability as other risk areas at Wells Fargo."

### Problems

But the seas were rough and our fleet was adrift…

* Without instruments, metrics, or a process
* Flooded by digital property types, delivery channels, and platforms

Sink or swim?

* Re-think
* Re-chart
* Re-educate
* Release

### New Strategy

* Surveyed the waters
* Took stock of our supplies
* Set our sights
* Devised a new strategy

Focused on essential functionality. What makes our product or service worth having?

Re-educated group by group by group:

* Spread the word
* Delivered training
* Provided tools and documents
* Ran some test cases

Release the new strategy!

* Devised a schedule
* Made it official

## Process

Took a year to develop a process, talk with stakeholders, evolve it as we went, etc.

* Defined success criteria
* Collected feedback
* Integrated feedback to build the best key metrics reporting process possible

## Q&A

**Can you give a concrete example of one of your metrics?**  
One of our metrics is accessibility launch status. It measures how accessible your property is. The continuum goes from best case scenario to worst case. Best case is you finding no accessibility issues at all. Next is finding non-critical issues that need remediation. Next is finding critical accessibility issues that are blocking essential function – this needs a remediation plan. Next is when you have no process at all.

**Can you give us a look into what you do as an accessibility manager?**  
Day-to-day varies. My tasks range from trying to come up with tools to support metrics nad calculate them more easily, to presenting at conferences, to writing educational materials around accessibility, to talking with lines of business who have questions on how or when to test for accessibility, or what to do when they've found accessibility issues.

**How does your organization test?**  
It's incredibly varied. We have over 700 customer-facing properties. Properties are like a digital unit – wellsfargo.com is comprised of over 50 properties (e.g. bell pay property). Some testing is hired out to folks like Deque, SSB BART, TPG, and some of it is done in-house.

**How did you achieve sign-off on your metric system?**  
Because we're in the risk management division and because key metrics are a policy, sign-offs were easy. We have a chief operational risk person who ultimately makes decisions about what we're able to use for guidance and metrics. The chief risk person signs off.

**Who is responsible for doing the delivery of the reporting of the metrics?**  
We have a monitoring and reporting team. Online accessibility liaison for each business line records the metrics. Depending on the values, it triggers actions to our reporting team.

**Did you have to get buy-in from the line of business?**  
Short answer is no. We're an enterprise governance department, so we're allowed to make "declarations on high" because we hold corporate policies. That being said, the initial planning sessions helped and we took the feedback very seriously.

**Do any of your metrics reflect user feedback? Business gain from analytics?**  
We don't have information yet because we finished deployment last week. Complaints are a separate issue. We have a complaints management policy that says every line of business needs a way to address complaints from people with disabilities. There's a way to track when an accessibility-specific complaint has come in. We take it extremely seriously when someone isn't able to access something on the site.

**For the inventory tracking system, is there a scorecard you can look at across properties?**  
Yes, there are ways we can pull different types of analytics to look at what's going on across the inventory as a whole. We can get a feel of accessibility trends. And the inventory is for every domain of risk: security, privacy, domain authenticity, etc. We can pull all kinds of reports to see different trends and patterns. We also run a survey that ask questions that are very line of business specific to get more data from people on what's working, what's not working, areas that might be an improvement on our part, etc.

**What's an example that you made to the contract language?**  
Before, our accessibility clause read as more of a suggestion. The new language is much more, "we have a corporate policy; this policy conforms to federal and state laws – you must comply with this policy, and failure to comply means failure to comply with international, federal, and state laws." Vendors must affirm that they've read it and affirm that they've complied.
