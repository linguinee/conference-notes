## BBC

"At the core of the BBC's role is something very simple, very democratice, and very important – to bring the best to everyone […] Everybody deserves the best."

BBC's Diversity Policy: "Build in accessibility from the start when develping new products and services, and ensure sustainable and ongoing accessibility."

Font question!  
Arial or Verdana?

### Project Canvas

Building a TV platform from scratch.

## Fonts

Which fonts purport to be "accessible"?

* Dyslexie
* Lexie Readable
* Comic Sans
* Tiresias
* Open Dyslexic

Research:

* \> 40 research papers
* 11 font design projects
* Neuroscience
* Lab based formative testing
* Anecdotes and personal perspectives

Whittled the papers down to…zero. None had a sufficient methodology, but they had some things in common.

## Legibility + Readability = Accessibility?

**Legibility**

Ascenders, Descenders, Weight, Leading, Counters…

**Readability**

* Letter or word recognition
* Humanistic vs classic
* Character inversion
* Context and application

Spent a lot of time talking with font designers and typographers.

We found that counters (gaps within letters) are really important in distinguishing letters.

### Humanistic vs Classic

The argument for an "a" that looks like a handwritten "a" is just that – you're used to recognizing what you write. However, the classic "a" looks like no other character, while the humanistic "a" starts to look like other letters.

### Serif vs Sans Serif

Some of us read by spelling things out and recognizing individual characters, while others read by recognizing word shapes.

## Conclusions?

Designers and people with reading and learning disabilities collaborated together.

* Helvetica Neue
* Helvetica
* Roboto
* FontSmith FS Me
* Sassoon

Funny that Helvetica (one of the most widely used fonts) tested well with people with dyslexia, and FS Me tested well with people without.

We've learned that the font choice relies on the context, and things like color to help focus attention and decluttered design help as well.

## Q&A

**Have you created your own font?**  
It's certainly something we've thought of. We don't have font designers in house, but we've reached out before.

**What's "scientifically" "big enough"? Is there a way to evaluate how large font needs to be?**  
It's a hard problem because it depends on context. Is it bright, is the font thin, is it on a phone or computer?

**Is ALL CAPS truly more readable?**  
I personally find it more readable, but all caps on one page is kind of overwhelming. Again, user research is key.

**Have you looked at the effect of spacing between lines on legibility?**  
Yes, squashing things together is a nightmare. How much is generally enough depends on the font and the size. It's hard to put an objective, testable guideline around design. We all perceive things like color and shape in different ways, too, so it's in combination with everything else.

**It sounds like a lot of readability is about calm. For example, all caps or things squished together aren't calm.**  
Sort of. Again, it's subjective.

**You reference the Sassoon font which was used in primary school reading books in the UK. Did you look at the differences within locales?**  
No, we're primarily UK-focused. Internationalization wasn't a focus, but now since it's becoming more global, it's definitely a consideration. It adds a whole dimension of complexity, though.

**I'm wondering if more exposure to the font makes it more legible over time.**  
That's the question around usability and learnability. You need bigger and longer studies – it's also cultural, like you said. Is there an equivalent American font like Sassoon, for example?

**Is it realistic to have a perfect font for everybody?**  
There's so many contexts that you're probably looking at a font family. With different ages, school vs work, etc., I don't think you'll ever have one font. It's accessibility all over, isn't it? Everyone's different.

**Is it more useful to offer choices?**  
Choice is important, but you have to offer *meaningful* choice, informed choice that has benefits that are communicated to the user. Different customization engines approach this in different ways. Some give you a bunch of fonts and colors, but you have to give meaningful choice. Each one of those choices needs a specific function.

For something like this, we might have a foundation font, and everything builds off that. For all the fonts we've mentioned, they work well in very different contexts.
