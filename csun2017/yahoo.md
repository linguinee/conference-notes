24 hours is too long, 6 hours is standard, < 2 hours is what we aim for.

#### Automatic Speech Recognition

Our users are human, so why not our captioners as well? We can't rely solely on machines.  
The quality and synchronization matter to us a lot.

#### Progressive Delivery

Do we want to expose captions with a lower quality faster, and then make it better? We don't want to expose bad content ever, but the people who watch videos peaks around an hour and then falls off dramatically. Those people won't see captions.
