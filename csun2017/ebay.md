## eBay Accessibility

Many employees and hundreds of products!

What we have:

1. Solid foundation
2. Process inclusion
3. User research and testing
4. Prioritize work and requests
5. Availability and responsiveness

Assumptions:

* Executive/leadership support
* Established partnerships within the company
* Communications (internal)
* Constant evangelism, education, and training

### Solid Foundation

* Documentation
* Checklists (role-specific)
* Patterns to follow
* Tools for testing
* Maintenance and support
* Clear guidance

[eBay MIND Patterns](https://ianmcburnie.github.io/mindpatterns/), a11y playbook, automated testing tool, consistent guidance

### Process Inclusion

Design
* Collaborate with design standards team
* Attend design reviews

Dev
* Patterns to follow
* Definition of Done

Testing (QA)
* Automation
* Manual testing

Launch approval!  
Included in the product launch process, accessibility is one of 20 checkpoints required for launchig a feature. It means that we don't have to hunt down the teams before launch – they need to hunt us down.

### User Research and Testing

* Include PWD in regular test cycles
* third party validation
* Partner with the User Research team
* Engage with community groups
* Don't forget your audience!

We mandate that our testing partners include staff of people with various disabilities. We seek out opportunities to get more users involved.

### Prioritize Work and Requests

* Who gets our focus?
* Internal tools
* High visibility projects
* Customer issues
* Time is precious

Focus on main platforms – the desktop site, native apps (iOS and Android), and the mobile web site. Focus on more critical screens for primary tasks, those with the most traffic…but not the *only* traffic (e.g. sign-in, forgot password, check out, etc.).

### Available and Responsive

* Teams know where to come
* Create an approachable environment
* Set a standard for responding (e.g. 24 hours)
* Open to impromptu conversations
* Leverage more than just email
* Be accessible!

Weekly office hours, Slack channels, review meetings, leadership updates, hallway conversations, etc.

## Q&A

**How do you decide which bugs to fix?**  
If it's a P1 in production, we have SLAs (24 hours to fix). So depending on severity, we have different SLAs. If it's a P4 on an old tech stack, we might table it.

**How do you prioritize things like new work vs things already in production?**  
Generally, if it's an old site and we're going to replace it in a month, then we'll wait for the new site. However, if it's a critical issue, it still needs to be fixed.

Because eBay has so many products out there, some products didn't have accessibility requirements when they were released. So we need to balance technical debt and new releases. We primarily focus on new releases to make sure they meet the accessibility bar, but we want to increase accessibility in general and nudge teams to do so.

**Do you include community advocates in "available and responsive"?**  
No, this is more for our main accessibility team.

**Who are the people who enforce accessibility? Is it hard to be the trainer and enforcer?**  
Yeah, it's a bit hard, but we have those conversations with teams. This is also where the executive backing helps a lot – they can say, this is an expert opinion, not just a recommendation.

**How have you created awareness in the senior ranks?**  
We've spent more time, admittedly, with the people doing the work, so we haven't had the need to build empathy at the executive level.

**How do you train the developers to be self-sufficient and be able to learn on their own?**  
They're not completely self-sufficient, since there is testing. We've done some specific training for developers and testers. There's the eBay MIND patterns with guidance for developers, e.g. I want to make a custom button, what do I need to do to make it accessible? So developers have guidance, and we have guidance for design and how to build things. They'll ask for help.

We're trying to focus a bit on more formalized training in 2017, and still sorting that out (e.g. is it testing specific, or design and PM together, etc., looking into incorporating it into onboarding, etc.).

We record training sessions, too.

**How do you convince your VPs to let you grow?**  
We've made a lot of progress in the last two years, so when a VP hears it, they think we don't need more budget. There's no clear path – I don't have a great answer. We would like to grow, yes. It all comes down to budget.

**For those with a 20+ accessibility team, how does that work…? Are you heavily regulated?**  
Audience member: I work with JP Morgan Chase and we're very heavily regulated, so that helps.

**Is there any kind of tie-back to revenue? Impact on users?**  
We're fortunate to not get those types of questions.

**For projects that go off-the-rails before launch, do you have any approaches to get those renegade projects to only have the energy they should get?**  
Basically, we want to give people the help they need to get. If they come to us a week before launch, we'll be grumpy. At the end of the day, if they need to get something released, we'll help them.

We're working on a dashboard to motivate program managers to get their projects green and invested in improving their processes.

**Does your design community support your work?**  
We've been working with our design folks, giving sign off on design components and evaluating them for accessibility, giving guidance for what more they need to give to developers, for example.

We do have support for design leadership. We have a lot more work to do.
