## Color and Contrast in Design

Even if you see 20/20, your perception of color will be a bit different from someone else's. For example, is this trash can tan or grey?

"When we survey the characteristics of color effects, we can detect seven different kinds of contrast… Each unique in character and artistic value, in visual, expressive, and symbolic effect; and together they constitute the fundamental resource of color design." —Johannes Itten

### Itten's Color Theory

1. Contrast of Hue
2. Light-Dark Contrast
3. Cold-Warm Contrast
4. Complementary Contrast
5. Simultaneous Contrast
6. Contrast of Saturation
7. Contrast of Extension

### Color Expression

* Yellow – light giving
* Red – fiery strength
* Blue – passive
* Green – fruitfulness
* Orange – radiant
* Violet – mysterious

Tints represent the brighter side of life, shades represent the darker side.

## Colorblindness

People who are colorblind aren't actually *color blind*, but color deficient.

* Deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia
* Dichromacy (two functioning cones instead of three)
* Monochromacy (one functioning cone)

## Contrast

Can you just eyeball it?

Personally, orange and lime greens always make me double check. Orange is hard to get enough contrast with. Lime green in checkmarks nearly always don't have contrast.

### How to Use Contrast in Color

* If you aren't experienced in working with color, keep color schemes conservative, conventional, and simple
* Use subtle shades of natural colors
* Avoid bold, highly saturated primary colors except in areas of maximum emphases, and even then, use caution
* Choose colors that reside on the same quadrant of the color wheel
* Type must always contrast sharply with background colors to be readable

### Testing Color Contrast
