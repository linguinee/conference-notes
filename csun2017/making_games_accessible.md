Framing accessibility: "How would you make a game your grandma could play?"  
The percentage of gamers with disabilities increases in older age ranges.

[Includification: A Practical Guide to Game Accessibility](http://includification.com/)  
"Always focus on the gamer and good design practices, the disability will take care of itself."

## Regulatory Environment

* US Section 508
  * Refreshed standards published January 2017

"If you lock me into your control scheme then you lock me out of your game."

Ask yourself:

  * Map recoloring
* Third Tier

  * Text-to-speech output

Unfortunately, the cost of making a AAA game accessible to a totally blind gamer is too much for the potential number of increased sales, since the population of people who are totally blind is small.

Audience remarks on the above: it would cost less if games were made accessible to begin with, rather than a retrofit. Also, it's not just totally blind gamers that would benefit from improvements to the audio and user experience.

### Hearing Impairments

* First Tier
  * Closed captioning
* Second Tier
  * Changeable fonts
  * Changeable colors
* Third Tier
  * Options for ambient noise as text
  * Alternative reactionary input

### Learning Impairments

* First Tier
  * Tutorials
  * Sandbox modes
  * Difficulty levels
* Second Tier
  * Training levels
  * Intuitive menus

### FAQ

Don't these features allow bots and also interfere with platform TCR? **No.**

Aren't accessible features expensive to implement? **They can be.** However, the first tier and second tier improvements shouldn't be costly to implement, though the third tier improvements can be. Like someone mentioned, though, building these in from the beginning is far less costly than building them in afterwards.

Don't accessible features break achievements? **No.**

## Q&A

**You said you had a bunch of games for the totally blind on the iPad?**  
See me afterwards!

**What's your response to game developers for whom inaccessible environments or difficulty levels is a selling point?**  
Our goal is to expand the spectrum of games that are playable. Gamers with disabilities have said that they would rather the content be produced and not playable by them, since each game pushes the industry forward. So many people turn to Twitch and absorb the story and experience through someone else, too.

**What have you seen so far in the last year, especially with VR?**  
I have two VR systems in the lab. Part of me thinks that it'll be like the Kinect, where people were really worried about it taking up people's lives. VR isn't going to go away. I think we're going to have experiences where people with disabilities will be able to enjoy. And there will be games that people won't be able to play. For example, the nunchucks in Wii.

**We have a game accessibility arcade in the back!**  
Yes! Try it out! The controllers we helped create. The switches you can buy really easily.
