# Designing the Future with Science Fiction

Leena Haque and Sean Gilroy, BBC

Will future technology empower people with disabilities?

## Science Fiction

Sci-fi tech is imagined to make life easier and more convenient.  
Should the focus be on designing for accessibility?

Attitude(Environment + Impairment) = Disability

In science fiction, people with impairments (Anakin Skywalker, Professor X, Gazelle, Geordi La Forge, Yoda, Doc Brown, etc.) are badasses.

Why are we separating a group of people out and saying they're disabled just because they need support? Everyone needs support.

* Driverless cars
* 3D printing
* Exoskeletons

Innovation starts with imagination!
