## Advocating for accessibility

We have experienced disability

* First-hand (from birth, acquired)
* Second-hand (as a parent/child/sibling/relative/caregiver, in the workplace)

We learned we were causing problems

* Developers, managers, etc.

We want to make things better

* And we need help!

How do we get help? Why aren't we getting to where we want to be?  
…sometimes people just don't know (lack of awareness).

## Being right is not enough

* This is a marathon, not a sprint
* People disagree with us
* We're demanding something people aren't equipped to provide
* We're demanding something that costs money/resource

Not all problems can be solved with an email or a phone call.

### There is (sometimes) a better way!

* We need to be able to establish relationships (even when we're really pissed off)
* We need to meet people where they need us (and be there when they come around)

Advocacy is a chance to solve the problem from the inside. Sometimes this requires finding people to help achieve your goals. It require more work, and it's not always effective!

## Template for advocacy

* This is the problem
* This is how it affects people
* You can solve it
* If you don't, these are the consequences

Accessibility advocacy is…

* Practical
* Personal
* Technical
* Political

What *isn't* advocacy?

* Direct action/protest
* Legal action
* Venting/personal attacks

Why? They're adversarial. Not to say that they aren't valuable, but these change every subsequent interaction afterwards.

## Know your audience

Corporate policy

* Strategy: practical, personal, political, technical
* Sensitive to reputation
* Usually eager to be seen as leaders
* Can drive compliance (if not advocacy) through the company (slowly…)

Sales and marketing

* Strategy: practical, political, technical, personal
* Ask if a product and/or accessibility specialist is there
* Verify every claim (especially if they say "totally compliant" or "perfect accessibility")
* Don't oversell!

Product management

* Strategy: practical, personal, technical, political
* These can be your best advocates!
* Control product requirements, deadlines, budget
* Respond well to concrete requirements
* May be swayed by competitive analysis

Engineering

* Strategy: technical, practical, personal, political
* Often measured by performance and deadline
* May want to help, but aren't empowered to
* If you can show them how to do it better, they will learn

Product support

* Strategy: technical, practical, political, personal
* Often not a part of the product team
  * Their job might not even begin until the product is finished
* Ask for accessibility desk, if available

Legal

* Extra disclaimer: IANAL, this is not legal advice
* Strategy: political, practical, personal, technical
* If you're here, they're probably afraid of you
* Ask if a product team representative is here
  * If not, this is probably not an advocacy opportunity
* Don't oversell! They can read legalese

Accessibility organizations

* Strategy: personal, practical, technical, political
* These are *your* advocates
* They understand the technical and political angles
  * What they need are your experiences
