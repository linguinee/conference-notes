* 17% of CS graduates are women
  * 15-25 years ago, 34% of CS graduates were women
* 30% of graduates from gaming programs are women
  * USC announced that a majority of the school's interactive media and game division program for graduate students are women

## Games: Merging Technology and Art

* Technology empowers creativity
* Technology empowers art

**Opportunities in tech that inspire you?**

* Helen

  * Accessibility to people of all ages
* Kiki

## Empowering Storytelling

New innovations in AI and dialogue systems.

These stories pull you in as a player in different ways – there are so many different narrative techniques driven by the game mechanics.

Halo

* Master Chief is helmeted
* Don't want them to talk a lot because it's first-person
* A lot of narrative through the people around Master Chief
* Environment design is a huge visual storytelling methodology

Portal vs Uncharted 4 vs Inside

**What were some story experiences that resonated with you?**

* Bonnie
  * The first game that emotionally grabbed me was Ico
  * You can tell stories that can't be told in other mediums
* Shannon
  * I spent four hours last weekend to play Firewatch
  * I enjoy playing through games more than TV
* Helen
  * We see all sorts of different stories and adventures in Minecraft
* Kiki
  * Game communities are really important!
  * Halo is multi-generational – being able to give back to the stories is really powerful

## Play is Human…Play is Social

Gamers connect, self-express, and build community around many interests. As gaming grows to $100B globally, there are more ways for gamers to socialize both online and off.

Games are a canvas for self-expression, both in-game and out.

**What are your experiences socially with games, and what sort of cross-over you've had with real life?**

* Kiki
  * Halo fosters competition around co-op games
  * Games enabling shared experiences through self-expression, co-op experiences, and the shared experiences you can have over time asynchronously
    * e.g. recording a fast lap on a track leads to ghost cars
  * So many different ways of connecting through play or stories
* Bonnie
  * Pokemon Go – is it a game? a social experiment? exercise? It brought people together in real life and broke down barriers
* Helen
  * My family uses games to connect and stay in touch
  * Words with Friends, Fitbit challenges, etc.
* Shannon
  * Inside (the game) isn't multiplayer, but everyone who plays it wants to talk about it afterwards

## Games Inspire Creativity and Diversity in Gaming

Minecraft: 1) inspiring a new generation of people across age, gender, and geography to imagine worlds and create and 2) inspiring us to learn in new ways.

Minecraft: Education Edition  
Used for math, physics, urban planning, storytelling, etc.

**How have games been used for learning?**

* Shannon
  * The edition of Redstone to Minecraft turned it into a OOP course
  * Gaming-based curriculum: teaches teamwork, valuing diverse skills and inputs, collaboration
* Kiki
  * Two schools of thoughts:
    * Here's the experience
    * Here's a sandbox to play in
  * For us, seeing the emergent behaviors that come out of the latter is really interesting
  * Halo Forge standalone was just released – that in itself is exciting, some people use it to create new game modes or just art itself

## General Advice

* Shannon
  * If you love games, play them!
  * Start exploring some of the tools that are available (e.g. Twine for text-based adventure games)
  * Once you get used to telling stories and how people experience them, you're there!
* Kiki
  * Get your CS degrees!
  * Roles are a combination of tech and design
  * Go out there and start making stuff – hackathons, game jams, etc.
    * Lets you know what areas you're strong in
    * Teaches you to work across disciplines
* Helen
  * Don't let the lack of a degree hold you back
  * Skills and experience are something you can learn
  * Nobody can teach you passion
* Bonnie
  * One of the things that give you an edge up is things that you've made, showing up with a lot of passion

## Q&A

**What's the process in game making? I'm interested in storywriting – how does that process begin? How do you start?**

* Bonnie
  * It depends on the game
  * We have a whole narrative team
  * We focus on an overarching story first, and then the artists and designers get in on it
  * But a game like Candy Crush doesn't start from the story, but a game like Halo does
* Kiki
  * It often starts with the game mechanic

**Comments on the poor treatment of engineers in the video game industry compared to other industries?**

* Kiki
  * Since Microsoft is a software company, engineers are well-treated
  * I personally haven't experienced that, since I came from the creative side
* Shannon
  * The game industry has a reputation for being crunch-driven
  * As a senior manager, I have the responsibility to take care of the team

**What skillset did you have when you came into your entry-level position?**

* Bonnie
  * The game industry today is very different from when we all started – at the time, it wasn't really a career
  * Game design right out of college is super, super hard – but you can get into the platform side
* Shannon
  * Outside of core applicable skills, the non-core skills are problem-solving, breaking down problems, dealing with contingencies and ambiguity, maturity toward getting work done, teamwork

**What are your thoughts on trying to create narrative experiences which aren't necessarily conducive to the underlying game mechanics?**

* Kiki
  * With Halo, we've played around with mutiplayer and co-op game play

I stood up to ask a question and didn't take notes after this – didn't get to ask my question, either Q_____Q
