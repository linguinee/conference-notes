## Workshop
\#KnowMeIncludeMe

### Panel

* Shana T Bryant (producer)
* Gwynneth Leece (software engineer)
* Charlene Jeune (UX)

All working on emerging technologies such as Kinect, HoloLens, super secret stuff, etc.

### Agenda

* Introduction to recognizing exclusion in design
* Series of thought exercises around exclusion in design
* Call-to-action, specifically and especially for developers in emerging tech

### Overall Questions
* Have you ever encountered a product that didn't work for you? Like, for you, specifically?
* Have you ever seen an example of a feature that benefited you, but wasn't made specifically for you?

## Inclusion

* Devices with large screens: what about users with smaller hands
* HoloLens: head shape, nose shape/size, eye distance, hairstyles, glasses, ???
* Depth cues may be different for women, meaning possibly more motion-sickness

Developing for who we are can lead to bias! If we use our own abilities as a starting point, there are many biases: age, language ability, tech literacy, physical ability, gender, etc.

### Microsoft Principles of Inclusion

**1. Recognize exclusion**
  * Exclusion happens when there is a mismatched interaction between a user and a technology.
    * Identifying mismatched interactions between users and technology helps us recognize exclusion.
      * **Personas:** A persona is a representation of a particular human characteristic or ability.

**2. Learn from diversity**
  * Everyone benefits from things like: curb cuts, voice-to-text, automatic doors, brightness slider on laptops, handicapped-accessible stalls, potato peelers, etc.
    * **Persona spectrum:** A tool we use to help us understand potential mismatches across a spectrum of scenarios.
        * Permanent, Temporary, Situational

**3. Solve for one, then extend to many**

### Emerging Technology

* "Natural" human interaction
  * Using our bodies as controllers
  * The secret project problem
    * Designing only for ourselves
    * Data can be exclusive, too
      * Beauty.AI 2.0 ("First International Beauty Contest") was biased against people with dark skin
        * AI that determine how long people should be in jail (low risk vs high risk) are biased against black people
          * Human biases translate into machine biases

Let's define the future by: questioning what is "natural", getting out of our development bubble, and recognizing that biased data sets are bad data sets.

## Activities

Activity 0: Break some ice! Find a partner (or 2) and introduce yourself!

Activity 1: Recognize exclusion!

* Pick one persona card
* What tech excludes your persona?

Activity 2: What temporary and situational personas exist along your Persona Spectrum?

Activity 3: Choose a product (try to choose one that is a mismatch to your persona) and think about inclusive solutions for that emerging tech.

## Where To Go From Here

Being inclusive starts with changing our mindset!

* Consider how you benefit from things that may not have made for people in your group
* Take note when temporary and situational disabilities happen to you
* Observe how people around you are being excluded

Watch, read, and listen to media about often excluded groups
* *Diversifying Barbie & Mortal Kombat*
* inclusivethefilm.com
* *Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman*

Take advantage of methods and tools
* [aka.ms/inclusivetoolkit](https://aka.ms/inclusivetoolkit) (Microsoft manual and activities)
* User studies
* Crowdsource your user testing

We can all strive for diverse and inclusive teams! But don't assume that one person represents an entire group.
